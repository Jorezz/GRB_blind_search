# GRB data processing
I present package and notebooks with examples for GRB processing. Some of this data uses local files on my machine that originate from INTEGRAL data server in RSI RAS. Neverheless, this data is free to use via web script (https://www.isdc.unige.ch/~savchenk/spiacs-online/).

For any questions you can contact me by email: georgiy99@bk.ru
